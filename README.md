Problem Statement- AI-Powered Diagnostic Chatbot for Rural Healthcare Accessibility
In rural areas, timely healthcare access is limited, impacting the quality of medical interventions. Design an accessible, AI-driven chatbot platform (voice or text-based) that interactively assesses basic health symptoms, categorizes potential health issues, generates detailed preliminary diagnostic reports, and provides referrals to qualified medical practitioners in nearby urban centers.


Project Overview-     
      Arogyamitra ("Health Friend") is an intelligent chatbot designed to bridge the healthcare gap in rural and underserved areas. It functions as an accessible first point
      of contact for medical queries, allowing users to assess their symptoms using a simple 
      voice or text-based conversational interface. The platform provides a preliminary diagnostic report and connects users with qualified doctors, tackling the challenges of distance, cost, and limited access to medical professionals.
      Technicla Approach:
                     (1) Frontend: React.js, Progressive Web App (PWA), Web Speech API
                     (2)Backend: Node.js (Express.js) / Python (Flask)
                     (3) AI/ML: spaCy (for NLP), Scikit-learn (for classification model)
                     (4)Database: MongoDB (for user data), PostgreSQL (for referral network)
     Future Enhancements:
                      Arogyamitra is designed to be a continually evolving platform. The future roadmap includes:
                      Telemedicine Integration: Incorporate WebRTC to allow users to initiate a video or audio call with a registered doctor directly
                      from the app after receiving their report.
                      Integration with Wearable Devices: Allow users to sync data from fitness trackers and smartwatches
                      (e.g., heart rate, SpO2, sleep patterns) for a more comprehensive and accurate diagnosis.
                      Image Recognition for Symptoms: Implement a Computer Vision model (CNN) to allow users to upload images of visible symptoms (e.g., skin rashes, eye infections) for analysis.
                      E-Pharmacy Integration: Connect with local and online pharmacies to facilitate the ordering and delivery of prescribed medications.
                      Advanced AI Models: Transition to more advanced conversational AI models like Transformers (e.g., using the Hugging Face library) for more natural, context-aware conversations.
                     Government & NGO Partnerships: Integrate with public health dashboards and initiatives to provide valuable anonymized data for monitoring disease outbreaks and formulating health policies.
